# Surveys related to MCN within ten years
1. French, E., & McInnes, B. T. (2023). An overview of biomedical entity linking throughout the years. Journal of biomedical informatics, 137, 104252.
- Summary: This survey conducted a systematic review on biomedical entity linking related to history, applications, datasets, performance, and shared tasks based on literature from 1980 to August 2022, only 60 papers were included.

- Summary: It provided a comprehensive review on rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning models for biomedical entity linking with a special focus on knowledge graph (KG)-based methods; however, only four types of KG-based methods and six datasets were investigated.

In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (Vol. 2023, p. 14462).
- Summary: It performed a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of nine biomedical entity linking models (SapBERT, MetaMap, KRISSBERT, SciSpacy, MedLinker, ClusterEL, ArboEL, BioBART, and BioGenEL) across seven datasets (BC5CDR, MM-Full, MM-ST21PV, GNormPlus, NLM-Chem, NLM-Gene, and NCBI-Disease), aiming to identify the characteristics, reproducibility, and usability of different models. However, all of the models were only from 2019-2022.

- Summary: This survey presented a comprehensive description of recent neural entity linking (EL) systems developed from 2015 to 2021. This survey focused on the entity linking in general domain and it distilled a generic architecture of a neural EL system and discusses its components, such as candidate generation, mention-context encoding, and entity ranking, summarizing prominent methods for each of them. However, only 55 articles were included in the survey.

- Summary: This survey covered both clinical NER and RE and it encompassed current challenges, state-of-the-art practices, and future directions in information extraction from clinical text. However, ony 23 articles from 2018-2021 were included in the investigation.

- Summary: This paper first reviewed commonlyused biomedical named entity recognition (BNER) datasets and their potential annotation problems such as inconsistency and low portability. Then, it introduced a revised version of the JNLPBA dataset that solves potential problems in the original and use state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems to evaluate its portability to different kinds of biomedical literature, including protein–protein interaction and biology events. Lastly, it introduced an ensembled biomedical entity dataset (EBED) by extending the revised JNLPBA dataset with PubMed Central full-text paragraphs, figure captions and patent abstracts.

- Summary: This review surveyed the methods used in three important area: modeling and representing of time, medical NLP methods for extracting time, and methods of time reasoning and processing for the clinical domain. The review emphasis on the current existing gap between present methods and the semantic web technologies and catch up with the possible combinations.
